{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"001","title":"Digital Dreams","description":"Generative art exploring consciousness and technology through algorithmic patterns and digital landscapes.","fullDescription":"Digital Dreams is an exploration of consciousness and technology through generative art. This project uses algorithmic patterns to create digital landscapes that reflect the intersection of human thought and machine learning.\n\nThe work examines how digital technology shapes our perception of reality and consciousness. Through carefully crafted algorithms, the piece generates evolving patterns that mimic neural networks and cognitive processes.\n\nEach viewing reveals new patterns and connections, inviting the viewer to contemplate the relationship between human consciousness and artificial intelligence. The piece serves as a meditation on the future of human-machine interaction and the evolving nature of consciousness in the digital age.","category":"Digital Art","year":"2024","medium":"Digital / Generative","image":"fairies.PNG","tags":["generative","digital","consciousness"],"dimensions":"Variable","duration":"Interactive","techniques":["Algorithmic Generation","Digital Painting","Neural Networks"],"featured":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
