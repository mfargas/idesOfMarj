{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"003","title":"Creative Code","description":"Art created through algorithmic processes and code, merging technology with artistic expression.","fullDescription":"Creative Code represents the intersection of programming and artistic expression. This project demonstrates how code can be used as a medium for creative expression, producing art that is both mathematically precise and aesthetically compelling.\n\nThe work explores various programming paradigms and algorithms to generate visual art. From fractal generation to particle systems, each piece showcases different computational approaches to creativity. The project challenges the traditional separation between technical and artistic disciplines.\n\nThrough interactive elements and real-time generation, viewers can experience the creative process as it happens. The work serves as both art and education, demonstrating the potential of code as a creative medium.","category":"Generative","year":"2024","medium":"Code / Algorithm","image":"gatsby-astronaut.png","tags":["algorithmic","code","technology"],"dimensions":"Variable","duration":"Interactive","techniques":["JavaScript","Canvas API","Real-time Generation"],"featured":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
