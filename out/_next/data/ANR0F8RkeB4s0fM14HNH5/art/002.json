{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"002","title":"Abstract Realities","description":"Exploring the boundaries between perception and reality through abstract geometric compositions.","fullDescription":"Abstract Realities challenges conventional perceptions of space and form through geometric abstraction. This series explores the boundaries between what we perceive and what actually exists, using geometric forms to question the nature of reality.\n\nThe work employs mathematical principles and geometric relationships to create compositions that appear both familiar and alien. Each piece in the series represents a different aspect of reality - from the microscopic to the cosmic - unified through abstract geometric language.\n\nThrough careful manipulation of form, color, and space, the pieces create optical illusions that challenge the viewer's understanding of dimension and perspective. The work invites contemplation on how our brains construct reality from visual information.","category":"Abstract","year":"2024","medium":"Digital / Vector","image":"banner.png","tags":["abstract","geometric","perception"],"dimensions":"Variable","duration":"Static","techniques":["Vector Graphics","Geometric Design","Optical Illusion"],"featured":false}},"__N_SSG":true}
